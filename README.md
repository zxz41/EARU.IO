# EARU.IO
My shameless PHP website, blog and private cloud service.
There are 0 dependencies but bootstrap. The complete frontend Javascript code, and the PHP backend were created by my own hands
with absolutely no shame in using those technologies.

### Note
The orignal repo was made private/deleted about half a year ago.
Some of the code might be reverse engineered from the actual site.
Security issues might still be present so use at your own risk!
